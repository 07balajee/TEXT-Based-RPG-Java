Text-Based Adventure Game

A Beginner Friendly Java Project for Text-Based RPG Simulation

Description

A console-based Java application simulating a text-based adventure game where players explore a dungeon, battle enemies like goblins, collect items such as potions, manage inventory, and aim to reach the exit using commands (e.g., "move", "fight"). Designed to illustrate object-oriented programming (encapsulation, abstraction), exception handling, and game logic for a single-player RPG. Perfect for students and developers learning Java and game development fundamentals.

Features

Dynamic dungeon exploration with directional moves. Combat system with enemy battles and health tracking. Item collection (e.g., potions) and inventory management. Use items to heal or enhance abilities. Interactive text-based menu with clear commands. Game over condition on health depletion or exit.

Objectives

Demonstrate OOP principles like encapsulation (private health, inventory) and abstraction (simplified command interfaces). Incorporate exception handling for invalid inputs. Simulate RPG mechanics for educational and entertainment purposes.
